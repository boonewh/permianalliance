                <h2>Heavy-Duty Heating for Oilfield Operations</h2>
                <p>
                    Cold weather slows production, locks up equipment, and brings entire 
                    operations to a halt. Permian Alliance provides heavy-duty indirect-fired 
                    heaters built specifically for the oilfield. Our Blaze 200 and Blaze 400 
                    Turbo units deliver clean, dependable heat for drilling sites, frac crews, 
                    production facilities, and winter operations across the Permian Basin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These heaters keep your fluids moving, your equipment online, and your 
                    people working safely — no matter how cold it gets.

                <h2>Applications</h2>
                <h3>Thaw Frozen Equipment</h3>
                <p>
                    Winter freeze-ups hit fast. Crews rely on these heaters to quickly thaw 
                    valves and manifolds, flowlines and hoses, pumps and fittings, and rig 
                    equipment. Targeted heat with tents or ducting gets systems back online quickly.
                </p>

                <h3>Support Drilling & Frac Operations</h3>
                <p>
                    On active wells and frac pads, these heaters prevent hydration units from 
                    freezing, blenders and pump trucks from icing, sand equipment lock-ups, and 
                    iron and manifolds from stiffening in cold weather. When every stage counts, 
                    reliable heat keeps the job moving.
                </p>

                <h3>Production Support & Flow Assurance</h3>
                <p>
                    Cold temperatures create hydrates, reduce flow rates, and cause freeze-offs. 
                    These heaters help protect wellheads, separators and treaters, flowback tanks, 
                    and water transfer lines. Consistent heat prevents shutdowns and production loss.
                </p>

                <h3>Worker Safety & Temporary Facilities</h3>
                <p>
                    Indirect heat is clean, safe, and ideal for crew trailers, safety tents, 
                    control rooms, on-site offices, and break areas. Maintains safe working 
                    conditions during extreme weather events.
                </p>

                <h3>Construction & Maintenance</h3>
                <p>
                    These heaters also support pad construction and maintenance tasks including 
                    concrete curing, coating and paint work, adhesive and epoxy setup, and 
                    equipment repairs under heat tents. They provide stable temperatures when 
                    winter would otherwise shut projects down.
